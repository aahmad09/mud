        <description>A dark blanket, contrasting with blacks and yellows, and the occasional white, which is shaped as a
            circle and sometimes a crescent. The void had brought malefic darkness that enveloped the ship, devouring
            everything inside the pitch-black curtain. Inside, the air is still and dense, the temperature low, and you
            can only hear the hum of the engine. There are stars far away in the south which dot the blanket in an
            ornate pattern. Towards every other direction...nothingness. You need to warp drive to a planet...

        <description>You land on the planet. It looks like a tropical planet, filled with unusual plants and creatures
            you've never seen before. Tall, lush, orange trees surround you.

        <description>You land on the planet. At first glance, it seems unlikely that life would exist on this planet.
            Deserts stretch out till the horizon, strangely beautiful, yet eerily frightening.

        <description>You land on the planet. It seems like this planet is an ocean planet. The corals underwater have
            the same shapes as the surface organisms, almost as if they want to mimic them as closely as they can. But
            these shapes server their purpose. Much like the trees on Earth grow leafed branches, the corals on this
            planet grow to huge size and have branches with specialized polyps. Small, bioluminescent creatures lurk in
            the depths.

        <description>You land on the planet. The explosive nature of this planet makes it impossible to sustain any life
            forms. The volcanic eruptions are too devastating and the conditions on this planet change too drastically
            during its orbit. Perhaps once it has calmed down, life might be possible, but the chances are slim.
