# MUD

## About & Motivation

This code is originally for a project in Computer Science II course at Trinity University. It is a text-based MUD in
Scala with object-orientation and multithreading to contain world navigation, enemy NPCâ€™s, and
inventory system. It also involves a basic networking system to allow for multi-player gaming where users can join and exit
without breaking system, type into a chat, and engage in combat.

## Usage

After the server is runs, use 'telnet <Ip Address of the server> 8080' command to connect to the server.
